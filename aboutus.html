				<p class = "paragraph1 paragraph1-md paragraph1-sm">The idea of creating custom-made, on-demand electronic devices was developed in 2015 by Nhan Dao. With the help of his friends, the process of customizing different consumer electronics was perfected, and at the end of 2015, Computer Colors was founded.</p>
				<p class = "paragraph2 paragraph2-md paragraph2-sm">In 2016, ColorWare contacted Alienware and began painting gaming consoles and PC’s for them. Before long the Minnesota-based company moved to Miami, Florida to work with Alienware. The partnership lasted about two years before the company decided to take their business back home to Iowa. The company believed wholeheartedly in their business and they wanted to be free to experiment with other product offerings, paint coatings, and art applications.</p>
				<p>In 2018, a machine shop was added to the business. The machine shop created fixtures to support the customization process. And later, Computer Colors began creating original custom products including, the Grip for iPad, and the Wedge, a stand for tablet PC’s.</p>
